// M18 Plan 2 / T18.2.2 — manage_tools meta-tool (per-session tool-group
// visibility).
//
// Server-only meta-tool for per-session tool-group visibility. The MCP server
// holds the session state (ToolSessionState); the bridge does not track it.
// Activating a group makes its tools appear in subsequent ListTools responses;
// deactivating removes them. reset() restores the default (`core` only).
//
// The tool definition ships with every MCP-server build (always visible — it
// is in the ALWAYS_VISIBLE_TOOLS allow-list in tool-session-state.ts) so an
// agent can always reach it before any other group is active.
